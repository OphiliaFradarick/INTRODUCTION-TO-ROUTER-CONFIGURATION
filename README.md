## STATIC ROUTE
The static route 
information is entered from the routerâ€™s configure terminal prompt (config)#, using 
the ip route command, which has the following syntax:
 Router(config)# ip route [destination] [subnet mask] [next hop]
 
Each static route can use a different subnet mask. This is accomplished using 
variable-length subnet masking (VLSM). For example, one static route could have 
subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and another could have subnet mask 255.255.255.252.
